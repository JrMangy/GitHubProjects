# Todays notes!

React is an open source view framework developed by Facebook.
* lets you define interfaces in JavaScript
* can render anywhere to anything
* Simple, powerful and composable

What React isn't:
* Not a web framework 
* Isn't a full fledged application framework
* not Flux or Redux





MVC:
* Model- defines what is in the database. Handles app logic
* View- Client based application. Renders data from Controller.
* Controllor- interracts with the model. Requests information from the Model, and sends to the view.

> React only deals with the View portion
